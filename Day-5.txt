Topic Covered ===> Introduction to SQL Joins

Concept
Joins in SQL are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.
They help in retrieving meaningful information from multiple tables, which is essential when data is normalized across different tables.

Why we use joins:

- To fetch related data from multiple tables in a single query.
- To avoid data duplication and maintain database normalization.
- To analyze relationships between different entities in a database.

Types of Joins:

1. **INNER JOIN** – Returns only the matching rows between tables.
2. **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)** – Returns all rows from the left table, and matching rows from the right table; NULL if no match.
3. **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)** – Returns all rows from the right table, and matching rows from the left table; NULL if no match.
4. **FULL OUTER JOIN** – Returns all rows when there is a match in one of the tables.
5. **CROSS JOIN** – Returns Cartesian product of both tables.

SQL Syntax

--> INNER JOIN

SELECT columns
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;

--> LEFT JOIN

SELECT columns
FROM table1
LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;

--> RIGHT JOIN

SELECT columns
FROM table1
RIGHT JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;

--> FULL OUTER JOIN

SELECT columns
FROM table1
FULL OUTER JOIN table2
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;

--> CROSS JOIN

SELECT columns
FROM table1
CROSS JOIN table2;
