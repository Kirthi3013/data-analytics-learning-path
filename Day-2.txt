==> Installation of MySQL

Installed MySQL successfully on my system.

Explored MySQL Workbench and the command-line client.

Checked installation with mysql -V to confirm everything worked.

==> Creating Tables in MySQL

Learned how to create tables using SQL commands.

Understood common data types like INT, VARCHAR, and constraints such as PRIMARY KEY.

Example:

CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    student_name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT,
    course VARCHAR(50)
);



Summary:

Today, I installed MySQL and practiced creating tables. I learned how to use different data types and set primary keys, which gave me a clear idea of how database structures are built.
